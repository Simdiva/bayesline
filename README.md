bayesline
=========

A Multinomial Bayesian Classification for Language Identification.

`bayseline.py` is used as a baseline system for the Discrimination of Similar Languages (DSL) shared task in COLING-2014 ((http://corporavm.uni-koeln.de/vardial/sharedtask.html). The best configuration of the system uses character 5grams as features and reports an overall accuracy of 94.3% . Detailed description of the DSLCC corpus and the performance of bayesline can be found: http://www.uni-koeln.de/~mzampier/papers/bucc2014.pdf
